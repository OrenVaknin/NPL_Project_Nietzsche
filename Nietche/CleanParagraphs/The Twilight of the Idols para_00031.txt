And what are these truths? They are things that are not yet held to be true. They are the utterances of a man who, as a single exception, escaped for a while the general insanity of Europe, with its blind idealism in the midst of squalor, with its unscrupulous praise of so-called “Progress” while it stood knee-deep in the belittlement of “Man,” and with its vulgar levity in the face of effeminacy and decay;—they are the utterances of one who voiced the hopes, the aims, and the realities of another world, not of an ideal world, not of a world beyond, but of a real world, of _this_ world regenerated and reorganised upon a sounder, a more virile, and a more orderly basis,—in fact, of a perfectly _possible_ world, one that has already existed in the past, and could exist again, if only the stupendous revolution of a transvaluation of all values were made possible.
