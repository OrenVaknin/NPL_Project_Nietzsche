As I made verses, never stopping,            Each syllable the bird went after,          Keeping in time with dainty hopping!            I burst into unmeasured laughter!          What, you a poet? You a poet?            Can your brains truly so addled be?          "Yes, yes, good sir, you are a poet,"            Chirped out the pecker, mocking me.
