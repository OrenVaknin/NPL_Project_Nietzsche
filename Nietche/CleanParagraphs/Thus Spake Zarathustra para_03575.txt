In evening’s limpid air,      What time the dew’s soothings      Unto the earth downpour,      Invisibly and unheard—      For tender shoe-gear wear      The soothing dews, like all that’s kind-gentle—:      Bethinkst thou then, bethinkst thou, burning heart,      How once thou thirstedest      For heaven’s kindly teardrops and dew’s down-droppings,      All singed and weary thirstedest,      What time on yellow grass-pathways      Wicked, occidental sunny glances      Through sombre trees about thee sported,      Blindingly sunny glow-glances, gladly-hurting?
