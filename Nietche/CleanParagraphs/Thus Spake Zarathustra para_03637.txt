Oh, weep ye not,      Gentle spirits!      Weep ye not, ye      Date-fruit spirits!  Milk-bosoms!      Ye sweetwood-heart      Purselets!      Weep ye no more,      Pallid Dudu!      Be a man, Suleika!  Bold!  Bold!      —Or else should there perhaps      Something strengthening, heart-strengthening,      Here most proper be?      Some inspiring text?      Some solemn exhortation?—      Ha!  Up now! honour!      Moral honour!  European honour!      Blow again, continue,      Bellows-box of virtue!      Ha!      Once more thy roaring,      Thy moral roaring!      As a virtuous lion      Nigh the daughters of deserts roaring!      —For virtue’s out-howl,      Ye very dearest maidens,      Is more than every      European fervour, European hot-hunger!      And now do I stand here,      As European,      I can’t be different, God’s help to me!      Amen!
