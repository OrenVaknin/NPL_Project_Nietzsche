As 'neath a shady tree I sat            After long toil to take my pleasure,          I heard a tapping "pit-a-pat"            Beat prettily in rhythmic measure.          Tho' first I scowled, my face set hard,            The sound at length my sense entrapping          Forced me to speak like any bard,            And keep true time unto the tapping.
