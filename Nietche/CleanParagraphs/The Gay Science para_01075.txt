So you jest at me, bird, with your scornful graces?            So sore indeed is the plight of my head?          And my heart, you say, in yet sorrier case is?            Beware! for my wrath is a thing to dread!          Yet e'en in the hour of his wrath the poet            Rhymes you and sings with the selfsame glee.          "Yes, yes, good sir, you are a poet,"            Chirped out the pecker, mocking me.
