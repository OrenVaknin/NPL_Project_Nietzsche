Calm heavenly roof of azure silkiness,             Guarding with shimmering haze yon house divine!           Thee, house, I love, fearâ€”envy, I'll confess,             And gladly would suck out that soul of thine!               "Should I give back the prize?"           Ask not, great pasture-ground for human eyes!                 My bliss! My bliss!
