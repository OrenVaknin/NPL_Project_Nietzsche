If I understand anything at all about this great symbolist, it is this: that he regarded only _subjective_ realities as realities, as "truths"--that he saw everything else, everything natural, temporal, spatial and historical, merely as signs, as materials for parables. The concept of "the Son of God" does not connote a concrete person in history, an isolated and definite individual, but an "eternal" fact, a psychological symbol set free from the concept of time. The same thing is true, and in the highest sense, of the _God_ of this typical symbolist, of the "kingdom of God," and of the "sonship of God." Nothing could be more un-Christian than the _crude ecclesiastical_ notions of God as a _person_, of a "kingdom of God" that is to come, of a "kingdom of heaven" beyond, and of a "son of God" as the _second person_ of the Trinity. All this--if I may be forgiven the phrase--is like thrusting one's fist into the eye (and what an eye!) of the Gospels: a disrespect for symbols amounting to _world-historical cynicism_.... But it is nevertheless obvious enough what is meant by the symbols "Father" and "Son"--not, of course, to every one--: the word "Son" expresses _entrance_ into the feeling that there is a general transformation of all things (beatitude), and "Father" expresses _that feeling itself_--the sensation of eternity and of perfection.--I am ashamed to remind you of what the church has made of this symbolism: has it not set an Amphitryon story[13] at the threshold of the Christian "faith"? And a dogma of "immaculate conception" for good measure?... _And thereby it has robbed conception of its immaculateness_--
