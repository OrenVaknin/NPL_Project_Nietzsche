THE MOST ANCIENT MEANS OF SOLACE.—First stage: In every misfortune or discomfort man sees something for which he must make somebody else suffer, no matter who—in this way he finds out the amount of power still remaining to him; and this consoles him. Second stage: In every misfortune or discomfort, man sees a punishment, _i.e._ an expiation of guilt and the means by which he may get rid of the malicious enchantment of a real or apparent wrong. When he perceives the _advantage_ which misfortune bring with it, he believes he need no longer make another person suffer for it—he gives up this kind of satisfaction, because he now has another.
