Once more, St Mark, thy pigeons meet my gaze,             The Square lies still, in slumbering morning mood:           In soft, cool air I fashion idle lays,             Speeding them skyward like a pigeon's brood:               And then recall my minions           To tie fresh rhymes upon their willing pinions.                 My bliss! My bliss!
