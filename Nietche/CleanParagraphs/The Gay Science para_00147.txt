See the infant, helpless creeping—                    Swine around it grunt swine-talk—                  Weeping always, naught but weeping,                    Will it ever learn to walk?                  Never fear! Just wait, I swear it                    Soon to dance will be inclined,                  And this babe, when two legs bear it,                    Standing on its head you'll find.
