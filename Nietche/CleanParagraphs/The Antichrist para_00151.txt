Whoever sought for signs of an ironical divinity's hand in the great drama of existence would find no small indication thereof in the _stupendous question-mark_ that is called Christianity. That mankind should be on its knees before the very antithesis of what was the origin, the meaning and the _law_ of the Gospels--that in the concept of the "church" the very things should be pronounced holy that the "bearer of glad tidings" regards as _beneath_ him and _behind_ him--it would be impossible to surpass this as a grand example of _world-historical irony_--
