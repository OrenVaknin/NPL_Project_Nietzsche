WHAT IS VOLITION?—We laugh at a man who, stepping out of his room at the very minute when the sun is rising, says, “It is my _will_ that the sun shall rise”; or at him who, unable to stop a wheel, says, “I _wish_ it to roll”; or, again, at him who, thrown in a wrestling match, says, “Here I lie, but here I _wish_ to lie.” But, joking apart, do we not act like one of these three persons whenever we use the expression “I wish”?
