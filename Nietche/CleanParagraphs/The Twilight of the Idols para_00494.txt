This “messenger of glad tidings” died as he lived and as he taught—_not_ in order “to save mankind,” but in order to show how one ought to live. It was a mode of life that he bequeathed to mankind: his behaviour before his judges, his attitude towards his executioners, his accusers, and all kinds of calumny and scorn,—his demeanour on the _cross._ He offers no resistance; he does not defend his rights; he takes no step to ward off the most extreme consequences, he does more,—he provokes them. And he prays, suffers and loves with those, in those, who treat him ill.... _Not_ to defend one’s self, _not_ to show anger, not to hold anyone responsible.... But to refrain from resisting even the evil one,—to _love_ him....
