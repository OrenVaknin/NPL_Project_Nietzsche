Nor are professional theologians the only ones who have failed to answer Nietzsche; for in other than religious matters the majority of savants have not succeeded in plumbing his depths. There is, for example, the question of race. Ten years ago, twenty years after the publication of _The Dawn of Day_, Nietzsche’s countrymen enthusiastically hailed a book which has recently been translated into English, Chamberlain’s _Foundations of __ the Nineteenth Century_. In this book the Teutons are said to be superior to all the other peoples in the world, the reason given being that they have kept their race pure. It is due to this purity of race that they have produced so many great men; for every “good” man in history is a Teuton, and every bad man something else. Considerable skill is exhibited by the author in filching from his opponents the Latins their best trump cards, and likewise _the_ trump card, Jesus Christ, from the Jews; for Jesus Christ, according to Chamberlain’s very plausible argument, was not a Jew but an Aryan, _i.e._ a member of that great family of which the Teutons are a branch.
