Thou hearst me breathing,      Thou o’erhearst my heart,      Thou ever jealous one!      —Of what, pray, ever jealous?      Off!  Off!      For why the ladder?      Wouldst thou GET IN?      To heart in-clamber?      To mine own secretest      Conceptions in-clamber?      Shameless one!  Thou unknown one!—Thief!      What seekst thou by thy stealing?      What seekst thou by thy hearkening?      What seekst thou by thy torturing?      Thou torturer!      Thou—hangman-God!      Or shall I, as the mastiffs do,      Roll me before thee?      And cringing, enraptured, frantical,      My tail friendly—waggle!
