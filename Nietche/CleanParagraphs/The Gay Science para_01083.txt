"You are merry lovers and false and gay,                 In frolics and sport you pass the day;                 Whilst in the North, I shudder to say,                 I worshipped a woman, hideous and gray,                 Her name was Truth, so I heard them say,                 But I left her there and I flew away                         To the South!"
