Thus had I sunken one day      From mine own truth-insanity,      From mine own fervid day-longings,      Of day aweary, sick of sunshine,      —Sunk downwards, evenwards, shadowwards:      By one sole trueness      All scorched and thirsty:      —Bethinkst thou still, bethinkst thou, burning heart,      How then thou thirstedest?—      THAT I SHOULD BANNED BE      FROM ALL THE TRUENESS!      MERE FOOL!  MERE POET!
