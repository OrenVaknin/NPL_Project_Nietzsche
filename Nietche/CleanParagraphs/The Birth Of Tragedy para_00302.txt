My friends, ye who believe in Dionysian music, ye know also what tragedy means to us. There we have tragic myth, born anew from music,--and in this latest birth ye can hope for everything and forget what is most afflicting. What is most afflicting to all of us, however, is--the prolonged degradation in which the German genius has lived estranged from house and home in the service of malignant dwarfs. Ye understand my allusion--as ye will also, in conclusion, understand my hopes.
