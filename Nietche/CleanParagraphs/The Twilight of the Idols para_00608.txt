The present world of forces leads back to a state of greatest simplicity in these forces: it likewise leads forwards to such a state,â€”cannot and must not _both_ states be identical? No incalculable number of states can evolve out of a system of limited forces, that is to say, out of a given quantity of energy which may be precisely measured. Only when we falsely assume that space is unlimited, and that therefore energy gradually becomes dissipated, can the final state be an unproductive and lifeless one.
