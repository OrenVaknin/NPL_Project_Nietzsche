—Our age is proud of its historical sense: how could it allow itself to be convinced of the nonsensical idea that at the beginning Christianity consisted only of the _clumsy fable of the thaumaturgist and of the Saviour,_ and that all its spiritual and symbolic side was only developed later? On the contrary: the history of Christianity—from the death on the cross onwards—is the history of a gradual and ever coarser misunderstanding of an original symbolism. With every extension of Christianity over ever larger and ruder masses, who were ever less able to grasp its first principles, the need of _vulgarising and barbarising it_ increased proportionately—it absorbed the teachings and rites of all the _subterranean_ cults of the _imperium Romanum,_ as well as the nonsense of every kind of morbid reasoning. The fatal feature of Christianity lies in the necessary fact that its faith had to become as morbid, base and vulgar as the needs to which it had to minister were morbid, base and vulgar. _Morbid barbarism_ at last braces itself together for power in the form of the Church—the Church, this deadly hostility to all honesty, to all loftiness of the soul, to all discipline of the mind, to all frank and kindly humanity.—_Christian_ and _noble_ values: only we spirits _who have become free have_ re-established this contrast in values which is the greatest that has ever existed on earth!—
