In vain!      Goad further!      Cruellest goader!      No dog—thy game just am I,      Cruellest huntsman!      Thy proudest of captives,      Thou robber ’hind the cloud-banks ...      Speak finally!      Thou lightning-veiled one!  Thou unknown one!  Speak!      What wilt thou, highway-ambusher, from—ME?      What WILT thou, unfamiliar—God?      What?      Ransom-gold?      How much of ransom-gold?      Solicit much—that bid’th my pride!      And be concise—that bid’th mine other pride!
