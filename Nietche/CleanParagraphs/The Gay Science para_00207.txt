Around my neck, on chain of hair,                 The timepiece hangsâ€”a sign of care.                 For me the starry course is o'er,                 No sun and shadow as before,                 No cockcrow summons at the door,                 For nature tells the time no more!                 Too many clocks her voice have drowned,                 And droning law has dulled her sound.
