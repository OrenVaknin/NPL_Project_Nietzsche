Like to an arrow, methinks, a verse is,            See how it quivers, pricks and smarts          When shot full straight (no tender mercies!)            Into the reptile's nobler parts!          Wretches, you die at the hand of the poet,            Or stagger like men that have drunk too free.          "Yes, yes, good sir, you are a poet,"            Chirped out the pecker, mocking me.
