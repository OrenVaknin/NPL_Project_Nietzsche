MORALITY AND STUPEFACTION.â€”Custom represents the experiences of men of earlier times in regard to what they considered as useful and harmful; but the _feeling of custom_ (morality) does not relate to these feelings as such, but to the age, the sanctity, and the unquestioned authority of the custom. Hence this feeling hinders our acquiring new experiences and amending morals: _i.e._ morality is opposed to the formation of new and better morals: it stupefies.
