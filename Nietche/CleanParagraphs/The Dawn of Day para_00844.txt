OUR HAPPINESS IS NOT AN ARGUMENT EITHER PRO OR CON.â€”Many men are only capable of a small share of happiness: and it is not an argument against their wisdom if this wisdom is unable to afford them a greater degree of happiness, any more than it is an argument against medical skill that many people are incurable, and others always ailing. May every one have the good fortune to discover the conception of existence which will enable him to realise _his_ greatest share of happiness! though this will not necessarily prevent his life from being miserable and not worth envying.
