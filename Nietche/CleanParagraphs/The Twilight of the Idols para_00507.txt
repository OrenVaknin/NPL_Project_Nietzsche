—And from this time forward an absurd problem rose into prominence: “how _could_ God allow it to happen?” To this question the disordered minds of the small community found a reply which in its absurdity was literally terrifying: God gave his Son as a _sacrifice_ for the forgiveness of sins. Alas! how prompt and sudden was the end of the gospel! Expiatory sacrifice for guilt, and indeed in its most repulsive and barbaric form,—the sacrifice of the _innocent_ for the sins of the guilty! What appalling Paganism!—For Jesus himself had done away with the concept “guilt,”—he denied any gulf between God and man, he _lived_ this unity between God and man, it was this that constituted _his_ “glad tidings.” ... And he did _not_ teach it as a privilege!—Thenceforward there was gradually imported into the type of the Saviour the doctrine of the Last Judgment, and of the “second coming,” the doctrine of sacrificial death, and the doctrine of _Resurrection,_ by means of which the whole concept “blessedness,” the entire and only reality of the gospel, is conjured away—in favour of a state _after_ death!... St Paul, with that rabbinic impudence which characterises all his doings, rationalised this conception, this prostitution of a conception, as follows: “if Christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is vain.”—And, in a trice, the most contemptible of all unrealisable promises, the _impudent_ doctrine of personal immortality, was woven out of the gospel.... St Paul even preached this immortality as a reward.
