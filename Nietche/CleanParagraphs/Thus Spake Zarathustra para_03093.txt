—Nay!      Come thou back!      WITH all of thy great tortures!      To me the last of lonesome ones,      Oh, come thou back!      All my hot tears in streamlets trickle      Their course to thee!      And all my final hearty fervour—      Up-glow’th to THEE!      Oh, come thou back,      Mine unfamiliar God! my PAIN!      My final bliss!
