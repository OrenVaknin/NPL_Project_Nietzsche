—Ha!      Solemnly!      In effect solemnly!      A worthy beginning!      Afric manner, solemnly!      Of a lion worthy,      Or perhaps of a virtuous howl-monkey—      —But it’s naught to you,      Ye friendly damsels dearly loved,      At whose own feet to me,      The first occasion,      To a European under palm-trees,      A seat is now granted.  Selah.
