NEVER RENOUNCE.â€”Renouncing the world without knowing it, like a nun, results in a fruitless and perhaps melancholy solitude. This has nothing in common with the solitude of the _vita contemplativa_ of the thinker: when he chooses this form of solitude he wishes to renounce nothing; but he would on the contrary regard it as a renunciation, a melancholy destruction of his own self, if he were obliged to continue in the _vita practica_. He forgoes this latter because he knows it, because he knows himself. So he jumps into _his_ water, and thus gains _his_ cheerfulness.
