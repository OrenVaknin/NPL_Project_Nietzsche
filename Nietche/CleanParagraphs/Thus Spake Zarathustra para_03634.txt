Here do I sit now,      In this the smallest oasis,      Like a date indeed,      Brown, quite sweet, gold-suppurating,      For rounded mouth of maiden longing,      But yet still more for youthful, maidlike,      Ice-cold and snow-white and incisory      Front teeth:  and for such assuredly,      Pine the hearts all of ardent date-fruits.  Selah.
