This enchantment is the prerequisite of all dramatic art. In this enchantment the Dionysian reveller sees himself as a satyr, _and as satyr he in turn beholds the god,_ that is, in his transformation he sees a new vision outside him as the Apollonian consummation of his state. With this new vision the drama is complete.
