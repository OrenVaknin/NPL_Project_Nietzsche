Wonderful, truly!      Here do I sit now,      The desert nigh, and yet I am      So far still from the desert,      Even in naught yet deserted:      That is, I’m swallowed down      By this the smallest oasis—:      —It opened up just yawning,      Its loveliest mouth agape,      Most sweet-odoured of all mouthlets:      Then fell I right in,      Right down, right through—in ’mong you,      Ye friendly damsels dearly loved!  Selah.
