A man resorts to dialectics only when he has no other means to hand. People know that they excite suspicion with it and that it is not very convincing.

It can be only the last defence of those who have no other weapons. One must require to extort one’s right, otherwise one makes no use of it. That is why the Jews were dialecticians. Reynard the Fox was a dialectician: what?—and was Socrates one as well?
