I hate to follow and I hate to lead.               Obedience? no! and ruling? no, indeed!                 Wouldst fearful be in others' sight?                 Then e'en _thyself_ thou must affright:               The people but the Terror's guidance heed.               I hate to guide myself, I hate the fray.               Like the wild beasts I'll wander far afield.                 In Error's pleasing toils I'll roam                 Awhile, then lure myself back home,               Back home, andâ€”to my self-seduction yield.
