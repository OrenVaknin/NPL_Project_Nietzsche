_Better Deaf than Deafened._—Formerly a person wanted to have a _calling_, but that no longer suffices to-day, for the market has become too large,—there has now to be _bawling_. The consequence is that even good throats outcry each other, and the best wares are offered for sale with hoarse voices; without market-place bawling and hoarseness there is now no longer any genius.—It is, sure enough, an evil age for the thinker: he has to learn to find his stillness betwixt two noises, and has to pretend to be deaf until he finally becomes so. As long as he has not learned this, he is in danger of perishing from impatience and headaches.
