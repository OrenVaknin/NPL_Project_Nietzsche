Hail! hail! to that whale, fishlike,      If it thus for its guest’s convenience      Made things nice!—(ye well know,      Surely, my learned allusion?)      Hail to its belly,      If it had e’er      A such loveliest oasis-belly      As this is:  though however I doubt about it,      —With this come I out of Old-Europe,      That doubt’th more eagerly than doth any      Elderly married woman.      May the Lord improve it!      Amen!
