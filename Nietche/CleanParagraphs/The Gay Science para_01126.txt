Stern belfry, rising as with lion's leap             Sheer from the soil in easy victory,           That fill'st the Square with peal resounding, deep,             Wert thou in French that Square's "accent aigu"?               Were I for ages set           In earth like thee, I know what silk-meshed net....                 My bliss! My bliss!
