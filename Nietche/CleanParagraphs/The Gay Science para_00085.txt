My skin bursts, breaks for fresh rebirth,                  And new desires come thronging:                Much I've devoured, yet for more earth                  The serpent in me's longing.                'Twixt stone and grass I crawl once more,                  Hungry, by crooked ways,                To eat the food I ate before,                  Earth-fare all serpents praise!
