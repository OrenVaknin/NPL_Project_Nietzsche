From the dates of the various notes relating to it, _The Birth of Tragedy_ must have been written between the autumn of 1869 and November 1871--a period during which "a mass of Ã¦sthetic questions and answers" was fermenting in Nietzsche's mind. It was first published in January 1872 by E. W. Fritsch, in Leipzig, under the title _The Birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music._ Later on the title was changed to _The Birth of Tragedy, or Hellenism and Pessimism._
