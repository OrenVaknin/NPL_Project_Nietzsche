O man!  Take heed!      What saith deep midnight’s voice indeed?      “I slept my sleep—,      “From deepest dream I’ve woke, and plead:—      “The world is deep,      “And deeper than the day could read.      “Deep is its woe—,      “Joy—deeper still than grief can be:      “Woe saith:  Hence!  Go!      “But joys all want eternity—,      “—Want deep, profound eternity!”
