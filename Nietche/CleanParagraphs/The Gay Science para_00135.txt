Those old capricious fancies, friend!                 You say your palate naught can please,                 I hear you bluster, spit and wheeze,               My love, my patience soon will end!               Pluck up your courage, follow meâ€”                 Here's a fat toad! Now then, don't blink,                 Swallow it whole, nor pause to think!               From your dyspepsia you'll be free!
