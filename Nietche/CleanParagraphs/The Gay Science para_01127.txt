Hence, music! First let darker shadows come,             And grow, and merge into brown, mellow night!           'Tis early for your pealing, ere the dome             Sparkle in roseate glory, gold-bedight               While yet 'tis day, there's time           For strolling, lonely muttering, forging rhymeâ€”                 My bliss! My bliss!
