TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE _VITA CONTEMPLATIVA_.—Let us not forget, as men leading a contemplative life, what kind of evil and misfortunes have overtaken the men of the _vita activa_ as the result of contemplation—in short, what sort of contra-account the _vita activa_ has to offer _us_, if we exhibit too much boastfulness before it with respect to our good deeds. It would show us, in the first place, those so-called religious natures, who predominate among the lovers of contemplation and consequently represent their commonest type. They have at all times acted in such a manner as to render life difficult to practical men, and tried to make them disgusted with it, if possible: to darken the sky, to obliterate the sun, to cast suspicion upon joy, to depreciate hope, to paralyse the active hand—all this they knew how to do, just as, for miserable times and feelings, they had their consolations, alms, blessings, and benedictions. In the second place, it can show us the artists, a species of men leading the _vita contemplativa_, rarer than the religious element, but still often to be met with. As beings, these people are usually intolerable, capricious, jealous, violent, quarrelsome: this, however, must be deduced from the joyous and exalting effects of their works.
