The writing of the collected Explanatory Notes to _Thus Spake Zarathustra_, cannot be given any exact date. Some of them consist of comments, written down by Nietzsche after the completion of the book, and kept as the nucleus of an actual commentary to Zarathustra, which it seems to have been his intention, one day, to write; while others are merely memoranda and rough sketches, probably written before the completion of the work, and which served the purpose of a draft of his original plan. The reader who knows _Thus Spake Zarathustra_ will be able to tell wherein the book ultimately differed from the plan visible in these preliminary notes.
