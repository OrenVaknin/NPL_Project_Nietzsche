In sweat of face, so runs the screed,                  We e'er must eat our bread,                Yet wise physicians if we heed                  "Eat naught in sweat," 'tis said.                The dog-star's blinking: what's his need?                  What tells his blazing sign?                In sweat of face (so runs _his_ screed)                  We're meant to drink our wine!
