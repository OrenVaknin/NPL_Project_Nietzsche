FEELINGS AND THEIR DESCENT FROM JUDGMENTS.—“Trust in your feelings!” But feelings comprise nothing final, original; feelings are based upon the judgments and valuations which are transmitted to us in the shape of feelings (inclinations, dislikes).

Trusting in our feelings simply means obeying our grandfather and grandmother more than the gods within _ourselves_: our reason and experience.
