No grey old priestly devil,                      But, young, with cheeks aflameâ€”                    Who e'en when sick with revel,                      Can jealous be and blame.                    To greybeards I'm a stranger,                      And he, too, hates the old:                    Of God, the world-arranger,                      The wisdom here behold!
