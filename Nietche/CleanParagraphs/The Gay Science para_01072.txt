What doth me to these woods entice?            The chance to give some thief a trouncing?          A saw, an image? Ha, in a trice            My rhyme is on it, swiftly pouncing!          All things that creep or crawl the poet            Weaves in his word-loom cunningly.          "Yes, yes, good sir, you are a poet,"            Chirped out the pecker, mocking me.
