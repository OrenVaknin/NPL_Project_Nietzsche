Sophocles was designated as the third in this scale of rank; he who could pride himself that, in comparison with Ã†schylus, he did what was right, and did it, moreover, because he _knew_ what was right. It is evidently just the degree of clearness of this _knowledge,_ which distinguishes these three men in common as the three "knowing ones" of their age.
