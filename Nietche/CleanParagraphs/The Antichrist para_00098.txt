The things necessary to Buddhism are a very mild climate, customs of great gentleness and liberality, and _no_ militarism; moreover, it must get its start among the higher and better educated classes. Cheerfulness, quiet and the absence of desire are the chief desiderata, and they are _attained_. Buddhism is not a religion in which perfection is merely an object of aspiration: perfection is actually normal.--
