To the there-named south-fruits now,      Similar, all-too-similar,      Do I lie here; by little      Flying insects      Round-sniffled and round-played,      And also by yet littler,      Foolisher, and peccabler      Wishes and phantasies,—      Environed by you,      Ye silent, presentientest      Maiden-kittens,      Dudu and Suleika,      —ROUNDSPHINXED, that into one word      I may crowd much feeling:      (Forgive me, O God,      All such speech-sinning!)      —Sit I here the best of air sniffling,      Paradisal air, truly,      Bright and buoyant air, golden-mottled,      As goodly air as ever      From lunar orb downfell—      Be it by hazard,      Or supervened it by arrogancy?      As the ancient poets relate it.      But doubter, I’m now calling it      In question:  with this do I come indeed      Out of Europe,      That doubt’th more eagerly than doth any      Elderly married woman.      May the Lord improve it!      Amen.
