Thou who with cleaving fiery lances               The stream of my soul from its ice dost free,             Till with a rush and a roar it advances               To enter with glorious hoping the sea:             Brighter to see and purer ever,               Free in the bonds of thy sweet constraint,â€”             So it praises thy wondrous endeavour,               January, thou beauteous saint!
