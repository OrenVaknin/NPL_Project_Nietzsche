THE MORAL MIRACLE.â€”In the domain of morality, Christianity knows of nothing but the miracle; the sudden change in all valuations, the sudden renouncement of all habits, the sudden and irresistible predilection for new things and persons. Christianity looks upon this phenomenon as the work of God, and calls it the act of regeneration, thus giving it a unique and incomparable value. Everything else which is called morality, and which bears no relation to this miracle, becomes in consequence a matter of indifference to the Christian, and indeed, so far as it is a feeling of well-being and pride, an object of fear. The canon of virtue, of the fulfilled law, is established in the New Testament, but in such a way as to be the canon of _impossible virtue_: men who still aspire to moral perfections must come to understand, in the face of this canon, that they are further and further _removed_ from their aim; they must _despair_ of virtue, and end by throwing themselves at the feet of the Merciful One.
