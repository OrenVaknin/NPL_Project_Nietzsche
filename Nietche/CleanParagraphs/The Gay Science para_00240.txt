The pen is scratching: hang the pen!                  To scratching I'm condemned to sink!                I grasp the inkstand fiercely then                  And write in floods of flowing ink.                How broad, how full the stream's career!                  What luck my labours doth requite!                'Tis true, the writing's none too clearâ€”                  What then? Who reads the stuff I write?
