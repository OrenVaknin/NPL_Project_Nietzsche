This the finest air drinking,      With nostrils out-swelled like goblets,      Lacking future, lacking remembrances      Thus do I sit here, ye      Friendly damsels dearly loved,      And look at the palm-tree there,      How it, to a dance-girl, like,      Doth bow and bend and on its haunches bob,      —One doth it too, when one view’th it long!—      To a dance-girl like, who as it seem’th to me,      Too long, and dangerously persistent,      Always, always, just on SINGLE leg hath stood?      —Then forgot she thereby, as it seem’th to me,      The OTHER leg?      For vainly I, at least,      Did search for the amissing      Fellow-jewel      —Namely, the other leg—      In the sanctified precincts,      Nigh her very dearest, very tenderest,      Flapping and fluttering and flickering skirting.      Yea, if ye should, ye beauteous friendly ones,      Quite take my word:      She hath, alas! LOST it!      Hu!  Hu!  Hu!  Hu!  Hu!      It is away!      For ever away!      The other leg!      Oh, pity for that loveliest other leg!      Where may it now tarry, all-forsaken weeping?      The lonesomest leg?      In fear perhaps before a      Furious, yellow, blond and curled      Leonine monster?  Or perhaps even      Gnawed away, nibbled badly—      Most wretched, woeful! woeful! nibbled badly!  Selah.
