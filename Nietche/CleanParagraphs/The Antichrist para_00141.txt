The life of the Saviour was simply a carrying out of this way of life--and so was his death.... He no longer needed any formula or ritual in his relations with God--not even prayer. He had rejected the whole of the Jewish doctrine of repentance and atonement; he _knew_ that it was only by a _way_ of life that one could feel one's self "divine," "blessed," "evangelical," a "child of God." _Not_ by "repentance," _not_ by "prayer and forgiveness" is the way to God: _only the Gospel way_ leads to God--it is _itself_ "God!"--What the Gospels _abolished_ was the Judaism in the concepts of "sin," "forgiveness of sin," "faith," "salvation through faith"--the whole _ecclesiastical_ dogma of the Jews was denied by the "glad tidings."
